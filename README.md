# PyBer_Analysis
Exploratory Analysis of Rideshare Data to help improve access to ride sharing service and determine affordability to underserved areas
# Background
As a data analyst I was assigned to do exploritory analysis 

# Overview of Project ****This is specifically asking for me "Explain the purpose of the new analysis."
An additional request came in after the intial exploritory analysis to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type and create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type, to help provide insight on how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)

- Analysis (14 points)
The written analysis has the following:

## Results:
Total Rides
- The total rides by city type in order from highest to lowest were: Urban 1,625, Suburban 625, and with Rural 125.  Note, the total order of rides (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) naturally make sense with population denisty.
##
Total Drivers
- The total drivers by city type in order from hightest to lowest were: Urban 2,405, Suburban 490, and Rural with 78. 
  - Note, the order of total 
drivers is in the same order as total rides, which again makes sense with population density.
  - Another consideration to look into.  There are more total drivers than rides in the Urban area.  Why is this?  What is the relationship between drivers and rides?
  -If riders to drivers were a ratio of 1 to 1.  Assuming drivers, do multiple rides I believe it would make sense that the numbers of total drivers should be less then the total number of rides.  If not there is not enough work to go around.  One possibilities that there are many part time drivers.  
  - What is the ride to driver ratio?
  - - Urban:     1,625:2,405 67.67%
  - - Suburban:  645:490     131.63%
  - - Rural:     125:78      160.26%
  - What is the average ride per driver?
  - What is the driver to ride ration?
  - What is the average ride per driver?
  
  It would make sense that if you were a driver you would want to   

The relationship between drivers and ....It would also make sense with higher demand for rides that their would likely be a correlating order to meet demand.  The fact that drivers are hight
##
Total Fare
- The total fares by city type in order from hightest to lowest were:  Urban with $39,854.38, Suburban with $19,356.33, and Rural with $4,327.93.  Again this follows the same order.
##
Average fare per ride
- The average fare per ride by city type in order from highest to lowest were: Rural with $34.66, Suburban with $30.97, and Urban with $24.53.  
  - Note, the averabe fare per ride is in the inverse order from total rides, total drivers and total fares.  Assuming the pricing is the same, this is likely because due to logistics as rural location are mores spread out then suburban and suburban more spread out then urban.  If the locations for drivers are more spread out require more milage, the average price would reflect this.  
##
Average fare per driver
- The average fare per driver by city type in order from highest to lowest were: Rural with $55.49, Suburban with $39.50, and Urban with $16.57.  Note, this follows the same pattern trend as average fare per ride.  

Total rides, total drivers and total fares are highest in urban, then suburban and lastly ruaral cities.  The inverse is true for the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver, as rural is the hightest followed by suburban and then urban cities.

* ***This is specifically asking for "a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)"
Summary:

### Recomendations: **
***This is specifically asking for a "a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types"
